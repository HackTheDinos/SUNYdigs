# SUNYdigs

<h3><p><img src="/UX/images/digs_logo.jpg" align="left">Paleontologists throughout the 20th century used field notebooks to keep detailed logs of their expeditions. Previous work at the museum has given us these notes as scanned images and as very imperfect text transcriptions. The text has never analyzed for potentially relevant pieces of information that could lead to new understanding of past expeditions. These data are very frequently requested by researchers from around the world, but their imperfect nature make them less useful than they could be."</p>
     <p>  The SUNYdigs team decided that the best solution for this project was to gamify this "Dig Up the Past" challenge by creating a platform where users would transcribe without being overwhelmed.</p>
